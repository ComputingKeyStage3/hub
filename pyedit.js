   The Python editor, in one place.

   The colouring, the line numbers, the mistake spotting and the typing
   behaviour used to live inside lesson.html, which meant the builder's
   "Starter code" box was a plain textarea: no colours, no numbers, and no
   indent after a colon. A teacher wrote the code that students would open in
   the real editor, in a box that behaved nothing like it.

   Everything here is shared by both. lesson.html adds the parts only the
   student needs on top: running, the console, the turtle canvas and the help
